# HomesteaderUSA
Homesteading program to enable planning and documentation for the modern homesteader.

This first section of a larger program is ment to collect information on every animal on the homestead. It includes the ability to request
from the program the cost of feeding the animal and how much meat, milk, eggs, etc the animal produced as well as the cost per item or pound.
It takes information from multiple tables of input to include feed, medicine, breeding, purchase, sale and other pertinent information. 

Ideally it will have links to lists of common average costs for use in approximation of future expenses beforee purchase.  This is one 
section of a larger program which will eventually have kitchen garden, market graden, orchard, and CSA option moduals as well as personal and homestead diaries.

This project is the reason I toook software developement.
